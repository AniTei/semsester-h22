##Semester project 1, fall 2022, «Community science museum»

The purpose of this project was to answer the assignment given at the end of the first semester of my Front-End studies at Noroff, fall 2022.
The brief said to make an informative website for a new museum, «the Community Science Museum», its target audience being children and families with young children. 


Description

The project is a static, brochure kind, website. Its main purpose is to be informative for potential visitors. 

The site is made up of 6 pages:
- A front page
- An explore page, what different groups might find interesting at the museum
- A page showing the different exhibitions 
- A page showing upcoming events
- A page with practical information for visitors
- And a page for people interested in volunteering

The website is built to be responsive, and look good and thereby be user-friendly on different devices.

The website has a light yet serious design. The blue of the logo and body suggests a more traditional feel, while the light green details can be associated with ongoing climate challenges, and that the sciences play a role in solving these. Mostly white backgrounds and black font makes for a utilitarian site over all, taking into account that the main goal of the site is to be informative. 


Built With

The site is all hard coded. Most of the content was provided with the assignment, but some of the images I got from Unsplash. I worked in vsCode when building the project, and used GitHub to keep up with changes and versions. The project only uses HTML and CSS. The site is deployed to Netlify.
